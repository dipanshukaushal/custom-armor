# Custom Armor for Aternos Players [ IN-PROGRESS ]

🎮 This repository includes custom armor + weapons and data packs that can be used by Aternos players without needing to upload server-side mods/plugins or resource pack.
This Project is inspired by Hypixel's Skyblock Mode + more update will come soon in this Projects

## 🔧 How to Use this ( you can skip to 6 if you already have installed ItemTag & ItemEdit server )

1. Make sure you are running a paper/bukkit server
2. Make sure to install ItemEdit & ItemTag Plugins

4. Once installed, please restart your server and join in-game and check plugins by /plugins
5. Come to your server's hosting panel and open files
6. Go to `Files > Plugins > Itemedits > config.yml`
7. Copy the code mentioned in [Releases](example.txt) and paste it in [Releases](config.yml)
8. Once pasted, save the file and restart the server or reload the plugins by typing `/ie reload`
9. Now type `/ie show` and you will see the special sets + weapons in GUI
