# Custom Armor for Aternos Players

🎮 This repository includes custom armor models and data packs that can be used by Aternos players without needing to upload server-side mods/plugins or resource pack.

## 🔧 How to Use this ( you can skip to 0 if you already have a server )

1. Make sure you are running a paper/bukkit server
2. Make sure to install ItemEdit & ItemTag Plugins

Download the pack from the [Releases](https://github.com/yourusername/custom-armor-for-aternos/releases).
2. Copy the code from "example.yml" and paste it manually in item edit .
3. Use `/function customarmor:give_armor` to get the items.
